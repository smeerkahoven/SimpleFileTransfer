A project that born with a requirement to copie files from server to client to tranfers air tickets.

Initial code from 

https://gist.github.com/CarlEkerot/2693246

Thanks to CarlEkerot to upload the codebase of my SimpleFileTransfer.

To run:

Just run server with
java -jar FileTransferServer.jar

Server will save files in the root folder if you save FileTransferServer in /home/user/server
in this folder you will receive the files

To run the client

java -jar FileTransferClient.jar <ip> <folder with files>

<ip> the ip of the server

<folder with files> For example /home/cliente/FlightFickets/ 

inside this folder there are many files to transfer to server

hope you enjoy
